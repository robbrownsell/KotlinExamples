**Title: Unveiling Kotlin: Uses and Benefits**
**Slide 1: Introduction**
- Title: Unveiling Kotlin: Uses and Benefits
- Subtitle: Empower Your Development with Kotlin
- Brief overview of Kotlin and its emergence in the programming landscape.
  **Slide 2: What is Kotlin?**
- Definition of Kotlin: Kotlin is a statically typed programming language developed by JetBrains, known for its concise syntax and interoperability with Java.
- Key features: Conciseness, safety, interoperability, and tool-friendly nature.
  **Slide 3: Uses of Kotlin**
- Android App Development: Kotlin is officially supported for Android development, offering concise syntax and enhanced safety.
- Backend Development: Kotlin can be used for building backend applications, leveraging frameworks like Spring Boot.
- Desktop Development: Kotlin/Native allows building native applications for desktop platforms such as Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- Web Development: Kotlin can be used for building web applications, both on the frontend (with Kotlin/JS) and backend (with frameworks like Ktor).
  **Slide 4: Benefits of Kotlin**
- Concise Syntax: Kotlin reduces boilerplate code, making codebase more readable and maintainable.
- Null Safety: Nullable types and safe calls prevent null pointer exceptions, enhancing code reliability.
- Interoperability: Seamless interoperability with Java allows gradual adoption and integration into existing projects.
- Coroutines: Kotlin's built-in support for coroutines simplifies asynchronous programming, making code more efficient and readable.
  **Slide 5: Code Example: Conciseness**
```kotlin
// Kotlin
fun main() {
    val numbers = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
    val evenNumbers = numbers.filter { it % 2 == 0 }
    println("Even numbers: $evenNumbers")
}
```
```java
// Equivalent Java code
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
        List<Integer> evenNumbers = numbers.stream().filter(n -> n % 2 == 0).collect(Collectors.toList());
        System.out.println("Even numbers: " + evenNumbers);
    }
}
```
**Slide 6: Code Example: Null Safety**
```kotlin
// Kotlin
fun length(str: String?): Int {
    return str?.length ?: 0
}
```
```java
// Equivalent Java code
public class Main {
    public static int length(String str) {
        return (str != null) ? str.length() : 0;
    }
}
```
**Slide 7: Code Example: Coroutines**
```kotlin
// Kotlin
import kotlinx.coroutines.*
fun main() {
    GlobalScope.launch {
        delay(1000)
        println("World!")
    }
    println("Hello, ")
    Thread.sleep(2000) // Waiting for coroutine to finish
}
```
